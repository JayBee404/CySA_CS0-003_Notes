Intelligence loses its value over time

SIEMs can be configured to automate much of the security intelligence lifecycle

Configure the SIEM to focus on events related to things you need to know

All alerting systems suffer from the problems of false positives and false negatives

Problem with False Negatives - Security administrators are exposed to threats without being aware of them

Problem with False Positives - Overwhelm analysis and response resources

Use Case - A specific condition that should be reported, such as a suspicious log-on or a process executing from a temporary directory
- Data sources with indicators
- Query string used to correlate indicators
- Actions to occur when event is triggered
- Each use case should capture the 4Ws - When, Who, What, Where
