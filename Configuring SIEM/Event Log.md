Event Logs - Logs are created by the operating system on each client or server to record how users and software interact with the system

There are five categories of events in Windows event logs
1. Application - Events generated by applications and services
2. Security - Audit events like failed log-ons or access being denied
3. System - Events generated by the OS and its services
4. Setup - Events generated during the installation of Windows
5. Forwarded Events - Events that are sent to the local host from other computers

There are four categories of severity inside the Windows event logs
- Information
- Warning
- Error
- Audit Success/Failure

Event logs provide the name of the event, details of any errors, the event ID, the source of the event, and a description of what the warning/error means

Modern Windows systems provide event subscriptions that forwards all events to a single host and allows for a more holistic view of network events using an XML formatted message (.evtx)
