Security data comes from numerous sources across the organization

Normalization - Process where data is reformatted or restructured to facilitate the scanning and analysis process

Agent-based - An agent service is installed on each host to log, filter, aggregate, and normalize data on the host before sending it to the SIEM server for analysis and storage

Listener/Collector - Host that is configured to push updates to the SIEM server using a protocol like syslog or SNMP

Sensors - Allows SIEMs to collect packet capture and traffic flow data from sniffers and sensors that are positioned across the network

Data is aggregated across the network from multiple sources in multiple formats

Parsing and normalization interprets data from different formats and standardizes them into a single format for analysis and processing

Connectors or Plug-ins - A piece of software designed to provide parsing and normalization functions to a particular SIEM

Correlating events and reconstructing timelines can be difficult without date/time synchronization

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a time standard and not a time zone

Large organizations can generate GBs or TBs of log data every hour

Stored log data must be secured in accordance to the CIA triad
