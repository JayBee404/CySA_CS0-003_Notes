Known Threat - Can be identified using basic signature or pattern matching (malware, documented exploits)

Unknown Threat - Cannot be identified using basic signature or pattern matching (Zero-day exploits, Obfuscated malware code, Behavior-based detection, Recycled threats, Known unknowns, Unknown unknowns)

Zero-Day Exploit - Any unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong

Obfuscated Malware Code - Malicious code whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide through various techniques such as compression, encryption, or encoding to severely limit attempts to statically analyze the malware. 

Behavior-based Detection - A malware detection method that evaluates an object based on its intended actions before it can actually execute that behavior

Recycled Threats - Refers to the process of combining and modifying parts of existing exploit code to create new threats that are not easily identified by automated scanning

Known Unknown - A classification of malware that contains obfuscation techniques to circumvent signature-matching and detection

Unknown Unknowns - A classification of malware that contains completely new attack vectors and exploits
