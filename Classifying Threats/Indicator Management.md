1. Observed Data
2. Indicators
3. Attack Pattern
4. Campaign and Threat Actors
5. Course of Action (COA)

Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) - A protocol for supplying codified information to automate incident detection and analysis.

Malware Information Sharing Project (MISP) - Provides a server platform for cyber threat intelligence sharing, a proprietary format, supports OpenIOC defnitions, and can import/export STIX over TAXII.
