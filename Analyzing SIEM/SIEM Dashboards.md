Security incidents are identified and interpreted differently based on the overall threat level

Dashboard - A console presenting selected information in an easily digestible format, such as a visualization

Visualization - widget showing records or metrics in a visual format, such as a graph or table

Selecting the right metrics for the dashboard is critical

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - Quantifiable measure used to evaluate the success of an organization, employee, or other element in meeting objectives for performance

Our job as an analyst is to be able to understand these numbers and use them in the real world
