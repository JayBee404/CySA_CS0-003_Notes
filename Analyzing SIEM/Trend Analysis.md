Trend Analysis - The process of detecting patterns within a data set over time, and using those patterns to make predictions about future events or to better understand past events
Trend analysis can enable you to review past events with a new perspective

- Frequency-based - Establishes a baseline for a metric and monitors the number of occurrences over time
- Volume-based -  Measures a metric based on the size of something, such as disk space used or log file size
- Statistical deviation - Statistical Deviation Analysis - Uses the concept of mean and standard deviations to determine if a data point should be treated as suspicious

Trend analysis is dependent on which metrics are used for baseline and measurement
Things that may be important to measure:
1. Alerts and incidents
2. Time to respond
3. Network or host metrics
4. Training and education
5. Compliance
6. External threat levels

Attackers can use sparse attack techniques to bury their attacks within the network noise
Due to a large number of false positives, many analysts "tune down" their systems to be less sensitive

Narrative-based Threat Awareness and Intelligence - A form of trend analysis that is reported in long-form prose to describe a common attack vector seen over time
