1. Requirements (Planning & Direction) 
	- Sets out the goals for the intelligence gathering effort
	- What are the things we want to measure
	- What presents a realistic threat to the organization
	- What rules/regulations might be in place that defines how and what we can collect on?
2. Collection (and Processing) 
	- Implemented by software tools to gather data which is then processed for later analysis
	- Where we will convert all the data into a standard format (e.g. STIX) and how will we send it to an appropriate system, like a SIEM (e.g. TAXII)
3. Analysis
	- Performed against the given use cases from the planning phase and may utilize automated analysis, AI, and machine learning. 
	- Common to separate data into different categories such as "Known Good", "Known Bad", and "Not Sure" to assist in analysis and actions
4. Dissemination
	- Publishes information produced by analysts to consumers who need to act on the insights developed
	- Three common ways that information/reports are divided are:
		- Strategic - Broad themes and objectives for long-term goal structures, may further direct projects over weeks, months, and years (executive reports, presentations to stakeholders)
		- Operational - Applies to day-to-day priorities of managers and specialists. May be presented as a checklist or chart of categories or information that should be focused on today or in a short period of time
		- Tactical - Informs analysts/specialists in real time as they are analyzing incidents or alerts
5. Feedback (Review)
	- Aims to clarify requirements and improve the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information by reviewing current inputs and outputs.
	- How can we do things better and improve our implementation of intelligence?
