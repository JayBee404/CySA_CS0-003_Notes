We need to think about how we can take the intelligence we have collected and analyzed to turn it into something actionable. This tends to occur in the "Dissemination" stage of the Threat Intelligence Lifecycle, which can be further broken down into:
1. Risk Management & Security Engineering
2. Incident Response
3. Vulnerability Management
4. Detection & Monitoring

Risk Management - Identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes threats and vulnerabilities to reduce their negative impact.

Incident Response - An organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a cybersecurity breach or attack.

Vulnerability Management - The practice of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, remediating, and mitigating software vulnerabilities.

Detection and Monitoring - The practice of observing activity to identify anomalous patterns for further analysis
