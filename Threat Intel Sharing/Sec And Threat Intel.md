Security Intelligence - The process where data is generated and is then collected, processed, analyzed, and disseminated to provide insights into the security status of information systems

Cyber Threat Intelligence - Investigation, collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about emerging threats and threat sources to provide data about the external threat landscape

CTI usually comes in one of two ways:

1. Narrative Report - Blog-style reports that break down TTPs and potentially specific technical breakdowns of unique actions taken by adversaries/malware
2. Data Feed - Targeted operational-level IoC's (IP addresses, hashes, byte arrays, User-Agents, etc.) that are known to be associated with certain malicious activities or threat campaigns
