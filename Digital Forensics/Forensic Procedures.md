1. Identification - Ensure the scene is safe and secure to prevent evidence contamination, and identify the scope of evidence
2. Collection - Ensure authorization to collect evidence is obtained, and then document and prove the integrity of evidence as it is collected
3. Analysis - Create a copy of evidence for analysis and use repeatable methods and tools during analysis
4. Reporting - Create a report of the methods and tools used in the investigation and present detailed finding and conclusions based on the analysis
