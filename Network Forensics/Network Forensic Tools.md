Network traffic must be captured and its data frames decoded before it can be analyzed.

Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) - Allows for the copying of ingress and/or egress communications from one or more switch ports to another.

Packet Sniffer - Hardware or software that records data from frames and passes it to network media using a mirrored port or TAP device.

Ensure network sniffer is placed inside a firewall or on an important server.

tcpdump - Data-network packet analyzer that runs under CLI and displays TCP/IP that is transmitted or received on a network.

Wireshark - Free and open-source GUI-based packet analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.
