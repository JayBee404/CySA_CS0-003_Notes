Security Control - Mitigates vulnerabilities and risk to ensure the CIA, nonrepudiation, and authentication of data

Security controls should be selected and deployed in a structured manner using a risk management framework

NIST SP 800-53 contains a authoritative list of Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations

ISO 27001 is the international equivalent of NIST SP 800-53, but is paid

Earlier versions of the NIST SP 800-53 used classes of controls (technical, operational, and managerial)

- Technical (Logical) Controls - A category of security control that is implemented as a system (hardware, software, firmware)
- Operational Controls - A category of security control that is implemented primarily by people rather than systems (policies, procedures, physical controls)
- Managerial Controls - A category of security control that provides oversight of the information system(s)

Newer versions of NIST SP 800-53 do not use classes of controls anymore, but these are still used by the CySA+ exam objectives. 

### Functional Types

1. Preventative - A control that acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood an attack can succeed
2. Detective - A control that may not prevent or deter access, but will identify and record any attempted or successful intrusion
3. Corrective - A control that acts to eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion event

### Additional Types

1. Physical Control - A type of security control that acts against in-person intrusion attempts
2. Deterrent Control - A type of security control that discourages intrusion attempts
3. Compensating Control - A type of security control that acts as a substitute for a principal control
4. Responsive Control - System that actively monitors for potential vulnerabilities or attacks, and then takes action to mitigate them before they can cause damage

No single security control is invulnerable, so the efficiency of a control is instead measured by how long it delays an attack
