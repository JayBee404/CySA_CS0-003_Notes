Network Access Control (NAC) - Provides the means to authenticate users and evaluate device integrity before a connection is permitted.

802.1x - A standard for encapsulating EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) communications over a LAN or wireless LAN and provides port-based authentication

Port-based NAC - A switch (or router) that performs some sort of authentication of the attached device before activating the port

A broader NAC solution allows administrators to device policies or profiles describing a minimum security configuration that devices must meet before being granted network access

Posture Assessment - The process of assessing the endpoint for compliance with the health policy

Remediation - The process and procedures that occur when a device does not meet the minimum security policy

Pre and Post-admission Control - The point at which client devices are granted or denied access based on their compliance with a health policy

An endpoint health policy is just one of the rule-based methods of granting or denying access

Time-based - Defines access periods for given hosts using a time-based ACL

Location-based - Evaluates the location of the endpoint requesting access using geolocation of its IP, GPS, or other mechanisms

Role-based - NAC method that re-evaluates a device's authorization when it is used to do something (also called adaptive NAC)

Rule-based - A complex admission policy that enforces a series of rules which are written as logical statements (IF, AND, OR)
