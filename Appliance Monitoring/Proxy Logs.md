Forward Proxy - A server that mediates the communications between a client and another server, can filter or modify communications, and provides caching services to improve performance

Non-transparent Proxy - A server that redirect requests and responses for clients configured with the proxy address and port

Transparent Proxy (Forced or Intercepting Proxy) - A server that redirects requests and responses without the client being explicitly configured to use it

Analysis of proxy logs can reveal the exact nature of HTTP requests, including the websites that users visit and the contents of each request

Proxies that are set up to intercept or block traffic can record the rule that a request matched to determine an employee's intent

Reverse Proxy - A type of proxy server that protects servers from direct contact with client requests

Logs from a reverse proxy can be analyzed for indicators of attack or compromise, such as malicious code in HTTP request headers and URLs
