Port Security - The blocking of unauthorized application service ports on hosts and firewalls, or the physical/remote access ports used to allow a host to communicate on the local network

Appliances such as switches, routers, and firewalls are subject to software vulnerabilities and patching shortfalls like servers
Many network appliances are still running vulnerable, outdated, or unpatched versions of the Linux kernel
It is often advisable to disable web administrative interfaces and use SSH shells instead for increased security

1. Use ACLs to restrict access to designated host devices
2. Monitor the number of designated interfaces
3. Deny Internet access for remote management

Physical Port Security - Physical access to the switch ports and switch hardware should be restricted to authorized staff

MAC Filtering - Applying an access control list to a switch or access point so that only clients with approved MAC addresses can connect to it

Network Access Control (NAC) - Collective protocols, policies, and hardware that authenticate and authorize access to a network at the device level
