Anti-Virus (AV) - Software capable of detecting and removing virus infections and (in most cases) other types of malware, such as worms, trojans, rootkits, adware, spyware, password crackers, network mappers, DoS tools, and others

Host-based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS) - A type of IDS or IPS that monitors a computer system for unexpected behavior or drastic changes to the system's state on an endpoint

Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) - A software agent and monitoring system that performs multiple security tasks such as anti-virus, HIDS/HIPS, firewall, DLP, and file encryption

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) - A software agent that collects system data and logs for analysis by a monitoring system to provide early detection of threats

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) - A system that can provide automated identification of suspicious activity by user accounts and computer hosts
UEBA solutions are heavily dependent on advanced computing techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning

Many companies are now marketing advanced threat protection (ATP), advanced endpoint protection (AEP), and NextGen AV (NGAV) which is a hybrid of EPP, EDR, and UEBA
