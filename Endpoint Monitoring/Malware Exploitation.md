Exploit Technique - The specific method by which malware code infects a target host

Most modern malware uses fileless techniques to avoid detection by signature-based security software
1. Running lightweight shellcode/payload dropper or downloaders
2. Maintain access (schtasks, ASEPs, etc.)
3. Strengthen access (privesc, lateral movement)
4. Actions on objectives (data exfiltration, defacement, ransomware deployment)
5. Concealment (log deletion, LOLbins)

Dropper - Malware designed to install or run other types of malware embedded in a payload on an infected host

Downloader - A piece of code that connects to the Internet to retrieve additional tools after the initial infection by a dropper

Shellcode - Any lightweight code designed to run an exploit on the target, which may include any type of code format from scripting languages to binary code

 Code Injection - Exploit technique that runs malicious code with the identification number of a legitimate process

Living Off the Land - Exploit technique that uses standard system tools and packages to perform intrusions
