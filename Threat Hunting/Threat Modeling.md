Important questions to ask when beginning threat modeling:

- How can an attack be performed against the current state of the network?
- What is the potential impact to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data?
- How likely is the risk to occur?
- What mitigations are in place?

Threat Modeling - The process of identifying and assessing the possible threat actors and attack vectors that pose a risk to the security of an application, network, or other system.

It is important in threat modeling to think from an offensive and defensive perspective.

3 Main areas to consider when engaging in threat modeling:

1. Adversary Capability - A formal classification of the resources and expertise available to a particular threat actor.
2. Attack Surface - The point at which a network or application receives external connections or inputs/outputs that are potential vectors to be exploited by a threat actor.
3. Attack Vector - A specific path by which a threat actor gains unauthorized access to a system

Attack/Risk Likelihood - The chance of a threat being realized, which is usually expressed as a percentage.

Attack/Risk Impact - The cost of a security incident or disaster scenario which is usually expressed in cost.
