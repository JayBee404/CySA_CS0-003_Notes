Threat Hunting - A cybersecurity technique designed to detect presence of threats that have not been discovered by normal security monitoring.

Establishing a Hypothesis - A hypothesis is derived from threat modeling and is based on potential events with higher likelihood and higher impact.

Profiling Threat Actos and Activities - Involves the creation of scenarios that show how a prospective attacker might attempt an intrusion and what their objectives might be.

**Threat hunting relies on the use of the tools developed for regular security monitoring and incident response**

Pros of conducting regular threat hunting:
1. Improve detection capabilities
2. Integrate intelligence
3. Reduce attack surface
4. Block attack vectors
5. Identify critical assets
